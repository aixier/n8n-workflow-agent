# ⚠️ REDIRECTED TO MAIN PROJECT

**This file has been moved to the main project for unified guidance.**

## 📍 Main CLAUDE.md Location

**Primary documentation**: `/mnt/d/work/n8n_agent/CLAUDE.md`

or when in this directory:

**Relative path**: `../../CLAUDE.md`

## 🎯 Why This Change?

To maintain a **single source of truth**, all Claude Code guidance has been consolidated into the main project's CLAUDE.md file.

## 📚 Quick Access

### Working in n8n-workflow-agent

All workflow-agent specific commands and patterns are now in the main CLAUDE.md under:

**Section**: `## Essential Commands → ### n8n-workflow-agent (Python Agent)`

### What You'll Find There

- Critical Workflow Pattern (Analysis-First Approach)
- Environment Setup
- Workflow Management Commands
- Node Building
- Testing & Analysis
- Python Tools Architecture
- Mandatory Requirements
- Security Requirements

### Claude Code Skills

The 7 Claude Code Skills are also available here via symlink:

```bash
.claude/skills/ → ../../.claude/skills/
```

## 🚀 Quick Navigation

```bash
# View main CLAUDE.md
cd /mnt/d/work/n8n_agent
cat CLAUDE.md

# Or from this directory
cat ../../CLAUDE.md

# Search for workflow-agent content
grep -A 20 "n8n-workflow-agent" ../../CLAUDE.md
```

## 💡 Usage Pattern

When working in `n8n-workflow-agent/`:

1. **Claude Code automatically references main CLAUDE.md**
2. **Skills are available via `.claude/skills/` symlink**
3. **All guidance is centralized and up-to-date**
